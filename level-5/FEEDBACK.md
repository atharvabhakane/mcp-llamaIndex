# Project Feedback: MCP LlamaExtract Dynamic Server

This feedback is a straight-up summary of how the dynamic schema-based LlamaExtract MCP server turned out, what issues we ran into, and how they got fixed. The whole idea was to make extraction flexible â€” no predefined fields, just let the user decide what to pull from a document.

---

## What This Server Does

The FastMCP server is built around the LlamaExtract SDK and has a single, powerful tool:

### âœ… `extract_entities_dynamic`

* Accepts a list of entities (as strings) and a document (via `pdf_path` or `pdf_base64`)
* Dynamically creates a Pydantic schema using `create_model()` for those entities
* Either fetches or creates a new agent in LlamaExtract based on the input entities
* Extracts data from the document using that agent and sends it back as JSON

This avoids hardcoding any schema and gives full control to the end user.

---

## Errors We Faced (and Fixed)

### ðŸ”¸ `ImportError` from `llama_cloud_services`

* **Problem:** Trying to import `SourceText`, which isnâ€™t part of the SDK anymore (weâ€™re using v0.6.41).
* **Fix:** Removed `SourceText` usage and simplified file input to use direct paths or base64 decoding.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Agent creation failed silently

* **Problem:** Sometimes agents werenâ€™t getting created at all.
* **Cause:** Invalid or malformed dynamic schema or missing error handling around `create_agent()`.
* **Fix:** Added better exception handling and schema validation before calling the LlamaExtract SDK.

---

### ðŸ”¸ MCP Timeout (`error -32001`)

* **Problem:** The MCP server timed out waiting for LlamaExtract agent creation or extraction.
* **Fixes:**

  * Reduced unnecessary operations in the extract function
  * Moved to use `pdf_path` (Claude canâ€™t send base64 easily)
  * Ensured we only create agents if they donâ€™t already exist
  * Avoided extra MCP tool functions that could slow things down

---

### ðŸ”¸ Claude couldnâ€™t send files

* **Problem:** Claude doesnâ€™t send PDFs as base64, but our first version only accepted `pdf_base64`.
* **Fix:** Updated the server to accept both `pdf_path` and `pdf_base64` (with file existence check), so Claude works seamlessly.

---

## What Worked Well

* The **factory pattern** using `create_model()` for dynamic schema worked exactly as planned.
* Caching agents based on entity names prevented repeated re-creation.
* FastMCP setup stayed consistent with earlier levels, making it easy to plug this in.

---

## What Could Be Better

* We could clean up the `agent_name` logic and maybe hash the entity list instead of joining strings
* Right now all fields are treated as strings â€” handling arrays, dates, or optional fields would make this more robust
* Errors returned from the SDK could be surfaced in a more readable format (instead of raw exceptions)

## Final Notes

This server now gives you the ability to extract exactly what you need from any document, on demand, without touching the code for each new field. Itâ€™s flexible, clean, and working as expected with Claude + FastMCP. Youâ€™re good to go for Level 5.
