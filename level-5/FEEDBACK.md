# Project Feedback: MCP LlamaParse Server

This document provides feedback on the development and implementation of the MCP server for processing PDF files using LlamaParse.

## Tools Implemented

The following tools have been implemented in the `server.py` file using the FastMCP framework:

1.  **`extract_entities_2`**: This tool is designed to extract specific entities from a PDF document. It interacts with the LlamaParse API for primary extraction and includes a fallback mechanism using the `llama_parse` library directly if the API call fails.

2.  **`count_pages`**: This tool calculates and returns the total number of pages in a given PDF document using the `llama_parse` library.

3.  **`list_available_entities`**: This tool attempts to detect potential entity names within the text content of a PDF document. It uses a heuristic based on splitting lines at colons to identify candidates.

## Error Handling and Resolutions

During the development and implementation of the server, several potential error scenarios were identified and addressed within the code:

*   **File Not Found:** The `extract_entities_2` tool explicitly checks if the specified PDF file exists (`os.path.exists(pdf_path)`). If the file is not found, it returns a clear error message: `{"error": f"File not found: {pdf_path}"}`. This prevents the program from crashing due to attempting to read a non-existent file.

*   **Missing API Key:** The `extract_entities_2` tool also verifies if the `LLAMA_API_KEY` environment variable is set. If it's missing, it returns an error: `{"error": "LlamaParse API key not configured"}`. This guides the user to set up their environment correctly before running the tool.

*   **LlamaParse API and Library Errors:** Both the `extract_entities_2`, `count_pages`, and `list_available_entities` tools include `try...except Exception` blocks to catch potential errors that might occur during interactions with the LlamaParse API or the `llama_parse` library (e.g., network issues, API errors, parsing failures). The `extract_entities_2` tool implements a specific fallback logic: if the primary API call fails, it attempts to use the `llama_parse` library directly to load the document and return the raw text. Generic exceptions are caught, and an error dictionary containing details about the failure is returned.

While these mechanisms are in place, the use of broad `except Exception` blocks could be refined to catch more specific error types (e.g., `requests.exceptions.RequestException`, `FileNotFoundError`) to provide more precise error information to the user. The fallback in `extract_entities_2` could also be enhanced to attempt entity extraction from the raw text if the API specifically fails on entity recognition but returns text.

## Areas for Future Improvement

As noted in the feedback section of the README, potential improvements include:

*   Implementing more specific error handling instead of broad `except Exception`.
*   Enhancing the fallback mechanism in `extract_entities_2`.
*   Improving the entity detection logic in `list_available_entities` for better accuracy.
*   Adding comprehensive docstrings to all functions for clearer documentation.

This feedback file summarizes the current state of the server in terms of tools and error handling.
