# Project Feedback: MCP LlamaParse Server

This feedback is a quick, honest look at how the MCP server for PDF processing with LlamaParse is shaping up. I hope it’s helpful for anyone working on or reviewing this project!

## Tools Implemented

Here’s what’s up and running in `server.py` using FastMCP and the LlamaParse SDK:

1. **`extract_entities_2`**: Grabs specific entities from a PDF. You can use either a file path (`pdf_path`) or a base64 string (`pdf_base64`). It leans on the LlamaParse SDK for extraction and does simple entity matching on the text.
2. **`count_pages`**: Tells you how many pages are in a PDF. Works with both file paths and base64, using LlamaParse under the hood.
3. **`list_available_entities`**: Tries to spot possible entity names in the PDF’s text. It splits lines at colons to guess candidates, again using LlamaParse.

## Error Handling and Resolutions

A few common error scenarios came up during development, and here’s how they’re handled:

- **File Not Found:** The `get_pdf_path` helper checks if the file exists when you use `pdf_path`. If it’s missing, or if neither `pdf_path` nor `pdf_base64` is given, you get a clear error message.
- **Missing API Key:** The tools need the `LLAMA_API_KEY` environment variable. If it’s not set, the LlamaParse SDK will complain, and the error is caught and returned.
- **LlamaParse SDK Errors:** All tools use `try...except Exception` to catch problems from the SDK (like parsing failures or bad input). The error is returned in a dictionary with details.

That said, catching all exceptions with a broad `except Exception` could be improved—using more specific error types (like `FileNotFoundError` or SDK-specific errors) would give users better feedback.

## Areas for Future Improvement

- Catch more specific errors instead of just `Exception`.
- Make the entity detection in `list_available_entities` smarter and more accurate.
- Add thorough docstrings to every function for better documentation.
- Make sure there’s a `requirements.txt` listing all dependencies (`fastmcp`, `llama-parse`, `python-dotenv`).

This feedback sums up where the server stands now—especially with the new base64 input support and exclusive use of the LlamaParse SDK. There’s a solid foundation here, and with a few tweaks, it’ll be even better. Keep going, and don’t hesitate to iterate and improve!
