# Project Feedback and Development Notes

This document outlines the tools used in this project, discusses some potential challenges encountered during development and their resolutions, and provides details on the code documentation within the project.

## Tools Used

This project primarily utilizes the following tools:

-   **Python:** The core programming language for the server implementation.
-   **`fastmcp` library:** This library is crucial for building the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and managing communication over Standard Input/Output (STDIO). It significantly simplifies the process of defining, registering, and exposing tool functions.
-   **`pip`:** The standard package installer for Python, used to install and manage project dependencies as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
-   **Text Editor/IDE:** Any standard text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) capable of editing Python files was used for writing the code.

## Challenges and Resolutions

Developing an MCP server, even a simple one, can present specific challenges. Here are some common areas where developers might face issues and how the design of this project helps mitigate them:

1.  **Understanding and Implementing the MCP Protocol:** The Model Context Protocol has a specific format for requests and responses. Manually parsing and formatting these messages can be complex and error-prone.
    *   **Resolution:** The `fastmcp` library is specifically designed to handle the intricacies of the MCP protocol. By using `FastMCP`, the project leverages a robust framework that manages message serialization and deserialization automatically, allowing the developer to focus solely on the logic of the tools.

2.  **Establishing Reliable Communication over STDIO:** Standard Input/Output can be challenging to work with for bidirectional communication, especially ensuring that complete messages are read and written correctly without blocking or data corruption.
    *   **Resolution:** `fastmcp`'s `stdio` transport handles the complexities of reading from and writing to standard streams in a non-blocking and reliable manner, ensuring proper message boundaries are respected.

3.  **Defining and Exposing Callable Tools:** Making specific functions available as callable tools within the MCP framework requires a clear mechanism for registration and invocation.
    *   **Resolution:** The `@mcp.tool()` decorator provided by `fastmcp` offers a very clean and Pythonic way to register functions as tools. This declarative approach makes it easy to see which functions are exposed and keeps the tool definition close to the function implementation.

4.  **Managing Project Dependencies:** Ensuring that all necessary libraries are installed correctly for the project to run without compatibility issues.
    *   **Resolution:** A `requirements.txt` file explicitly lists the `mcp[cli]` dependency with a version constraint (`>=1.2.0`), making dependency management straightforward. The README provides clear instructions on using `pip` with this file.

5.  **Onboarding New Users/Contributors:** Helping newcomers understand how the project works, how to set it up, and how to interact with it.
    *   **Resolution:** Comprehensive documentation is provided in the `README.md` file covering installation, usage, project structure, and system architecture. The code itself is kept simple and includes docstrings (as detailed below) to explain functionality.

## Code Documentation

The codebase for the MCP Calculator Server is designed to be simple and self-explanatory. The primary form of documentation is through **docstrings** within the `mcp-calculator/calculator.py` file. Each function that is exposed as an MCP tool includes a docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, and what it returns.

Below are examples of the docstrings used for each tool function:

### `add` Tool Documentation

```python
async def add(numbers: list[float]) -> float:
    """Add a list of numbers together.

    Args:
        numbers: List of numbers to add
    """
    # ... function body ...
```

This docstring clearly states that the `add` function is used to sum a list of numbers. It specifies the `numbers` argument as a list of floats and indicates that the function returns a float.

### `subtract` Tool Documentation

```python
async def subtract(numbers: list[float]) -> float:
    """Subtract a list of numbers in order (left to right).

    Args:
        numbers: List of numbers to subtract
    """
    # ... function body ...
```

The docstring for the `subtract` function explains that it performs subtraction in order of the provided list. It also details the `numbers` argument and the float return type.

### `hello` Tool Documentation

```python
async def hello(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet someone by name.
    
    Args:
        name: Name of the person to greet
    """
    # ... function body ...
```

This docstring describes the `hello` function's purpose: to greet a user by name. It specifies the `name` argument as a string and indicates that the function returns a string.

By reading these docstrings directly in the `calculator.py` file, developers and users can quickly understand the intended behavior and usage of each MCP tool provided by the server.
