# Level 2 - Weather Server (FastMCP)

## üå¶Ô∏è Why I Built This

After getting the calculator working, I wanted to try something a bit more real-world‚Äîso I picked weather! This project is my way of learning (and sharing) how to connect an MCP server to an external API, handle async HTTP requests, and deal with real data (and real errors). If you're new to API integration, this is a great place to start.

## üöÄ How to Run This (Step-by-Step)

1. **Get a WeatherAPI key:**
   - Sign up at [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) and grab your free API key.
2. **Set up your .env file:**
   ```env
   [WEATHER_API_KEY](https://www.weatherapi.com/)=YOUR_API_KEY
   ```
3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python weather_server.py
   ```
4. **Test it!**
   - Send a request like:
     ```json
     { "tool": "get_weather", "args": { "location": "London" } }
     ```
   - You'll get back something like:
     ```json
     { "location": "London", "country": "UK", "temp_c": 18, "condition": "Partly cloudy" }
     ```

## üîÑ How It Works (Flowchart)

Here's a simple flowchart illustrating the process of getting weather information:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Request Weather] --> B{FastMCP Server Receives Request}
    B --> C[Call get_weather function with location]
    C --> D{Fetch data from WeatherAPI}
    D --> E{Process API Response}
    E --> F[Return Weather Data to Client]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è What Tool Is Included?

### `get_weather(location: str) -> dict`
Fetches the current weather for a given city or region.

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def get_weather(location: str) -> dict:
    """Get current weather info for a given city or region.

    Args:
        location: City or place name (e.g. Delhi, London)
    """
    # ... (see weather_server.py for full implementation) ...
    pass
```

This tool takes a `location` (city or region name) as input and returns a dictionary containing the current weather information (location name, country, temperature in Celsius, and condition text). It handles API key validation and potential HTTP or other exceptions.

## üí° What You'll Learn
- How to call external APIs from your MCP tool
- How to handle timeouts, retries, and errors gracefully
- How to return structured data to the user

## üßë‚Äçüíª Why This Matters
This step taught me how to make my tools actually useful‚Äîby connecting them to real-world data. Plus, I learned a lot about handling things when they go wrong (see the error flowchart above!).
