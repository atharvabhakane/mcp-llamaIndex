# Project Feedback and Development Notes

This document outlines the key tools and libraries used in the development of the MCP Weather Server, potential errors encountered during development or operation, and how these issues were addressed.

## Tools and Libraries Used

The MCP Weather Server project relies on the following tools and libraries:

-   **FastMCP:** The core framework used to build the server and expose the `get_weather` functionality as a tool.
-   **httpx:** An asynchronous HTTP client used to make requests to the WeatherAPI.
-   **python-dotenv:** Used to load environment variables, specifically the WeatherAPI key from a `.env` file.
-   **WeatherAPI:** The external service providing the weather data.
-   **Python:** The primary programming language used for development.

## Potential Errors Encountered and Handling

During development and in the potential operation of the server, several types of errors were considered and handled:

1.  **Missing API Key:**
    -   **Description:** The server requires a valid WeatherAPI key to function. If the `WEATHER_API_KEY` environment variable is not set (e.g., the `.env` file is missing or the key is not provided), the server cannot fetch weather data.
    -   **Resolution:** The `get_weather` function checks if `API_KEY` is available. If not, it returns a specific error message to the client: `{"error": "API key is missing. Set WEATHER_API_KEY in .env"}`.

2.  **WeatherAPI HTTP Errors:**
    -   **Description:** Errors can occur when making the HTTP request to the WeatherAPI, such as invalid location, rate limiting, or server issues on the API side. These result in HTTP status errors (e.g., 400, 401, 403, 404, 500).
    -   **Resolution:** The code uses `response.raise_for_status()` to catch these HTTP errors. A `httpx.HTTPStatusError` exception is caught, and an error message including the API's response text is returned to the client: `{"error": f"WeatherAPI error: {http_err.response.text}"}`.

3.  **Other Unexpected Errors:**
    -   **Description:** Any other exceptions that might occur during the execution of the `get_weather` function (e.g., network issues during the request that are not HTTP status errors, unexpected data format from the API).
    -   **Resolution:** A general `except Exception as e:` block is used to catch any other unforeseen errors. A generic error message including the exception details is returned to the client: `{"error": f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}"}`.

These error handling mechanisms ensure that the server provides informative feedback to the client when issues arise, helping users diagnose problems like a missing API key or issues with the weather data request.
